## Exercise 1

*Using the 173 majors listed in fivethirtyeight.com’s College Majors dataset [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/], provide code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"*

**There are three majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS"**

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Load packages --------------------------------------
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r read-data}
# Load data --------------------------------------
majordom <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/college-majors/majors-list.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r identify-majors}
majordom_data <- str_subset(majordom$Major, pattern = "DATA|STATISTICS")
majordom_data
```

<br>

* * *

## Exercise 2

*Write code that transforms the data below:*

>[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"  
>[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  
>[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    
>[13] "olive"        "salal berry"

*Into a format like this:*

>c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry")

### Generate a string that looks like the output

**We can generate a string that looks like that with the following steps:**

```{r}
# Generate input
line1 <- '[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"'
line2 <- '[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  '
line3 <- '[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    '
line4 <- '[13] "olive"        "salal berry"'
input <- c(line1, line2, line3, line4)
writeLines(input)
```

```{r}
# Combine the lines into one vector element
input <- str_c(input, collapse = " ")
writeLines(input)
```

```{r}
# Remove the numbers in square brackets
interim <- str_remove_all(input, "\\[(.|..)\\]")
writeLines(interim)
```

```{r}
# Trim the white space
interim <- str_squish(interim)
writeLines(interim)
```

```{r}
# Replace " " with ", "
interim <- str_replace_all(interim, "\" \"", "\", \"")
writeLines(interim)
```

```{r}
# Wrap the vectorized element with `c()`
output <- str_c("c(", interim, ")")
writeLines(output)
```

**However, this only looks like the output above but isn't a vector with these elements.  If it needs to be a vector we can extract just the fruit names from the original input collapsed into one vector element. WriteLines() doesn't return an output that can be assigned to a variable, otherwise we would have shown that, too.**

### Generate a vector that produces the same output

```{r}
# Extract names into a list 
output2 <- str_extract_all(input, "\"[a-z ]+\"")
# [a-z ]+ is not picking up " " because the beginning " is picked up already
output2
```

```{r}
# Turn the list into a vector
output2 <- unlist(output2)
output2
```

```{r}
# Remove explicit double quotes
output2 <- str_remove_all(output2, "\"")
output2
```

**This matches the output of: c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry")**

```{r}
# Show output of "c("bell pepper", ..."salal berry")
c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry")
```

## Exercise 3

### Escaped non special characters

*On #3, please don't assume that it's a typo when there is only a single forward slash.  That is, what happens when the second forward slash that R requires is forgotten?*

**Just above 14.3.1.1 in _R for Data Science_, Wickham & Grolemund write, "In this book, I’ll write regular expression as `\.` and strings that represent the regular expression as `"\\."`."  So I assume in the two examples without quotes he's demonstrating the difference between regex and the strings that represent regex.**

**Nevertheless if you do escape a normal character it doesn't just disappear. Otherwise the second and third code chunks below would have equivalent output. Instead we see that `"\1"` becomes an invisible character. You can see in the examples below that while `"A\1\1"` is matched by both `"(.)"` and `"(.)\1\1"`, `"AAA", "BBB", "B11"` don't match with `"(.)\1\1"` because they don't have those two escaped normal characters.**

```{r}
# Writing the string "(.)\1\1" returns "(.)" but they are not equivalent in the examples below
writeLines("(.)\1\1")
```

```{r}
# Running string_view using "(.)\1\1" matches the first instance of any character followed by
# two escaped 1s.
sample_string <- c("AAA", "BBB", "B11", "A\1\1")
str_view(sample_string, "(.)\1\1")
```

```{r}
# Running string_view using "(.)" matches the first instance of any character
sample_string <- c("AAA", "BBB", "B11", "A\1\1")
str_view(sample_string, "(.)")
```

### Exercise 3A

*Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:*

`(.)\1\1`

**This will match any character (except `\n`) repeated three times consecutively.**

```{r}
sample_string <- c("AAA", "BBB", "BCCC", "ABBCB")
str_view(sample_string, "(.)\\1\\1")
```

### Exercise 3B

`"(.)(.)\\2\\1"`

**This will match any two characters, repeated in reverse.**

```{r}
sample_string <- c("ANNA", "BABA", "UOMMO", "ABBACADABBADOO")
str_view_all(sample_string, "(.)(.)\\2\\1")
```

### Exercise 3C

`(..)\1`

**This will match any two characters, repeated.**

```{r}
sample_string <- c("MAMA", "PAPA", "GAGAGA", "HAHAHAHA")
str_view_all(sample_string, "(..)\\1")
```

### Exercise 3D

`"(.).\\1.\\1"`

**This will match five characters that have the same first, third and fifth character.**

```{r}
sample_string <- c("DADDY", "DADADY", "NANNA", "NANXN")
str_view(sample_string, "(.).\\1.\\1")
```

### Exercise 3E

`"(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1"`

**This will match any three characters, repeated in reverse, with no or any number of characters in between.**

```{r}
sample_string <- c("ABCCB", "ABCCBA", "ABCXCBA", "ABCXYCBA", "ABCX CBAY")
str_view(sample_string, "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1")
```

<br>

* * *

## Exercise 4

### Exercise 4A

*Construct regular expressions to match words that:*

*Start and end with the same character.*

**`"^(.).*\\1$"`**

**See below, only the vector elements that start and end with the same character are viewed.**

```{r}
sample_string <- c("ABCCB", "ABCXCBA", "ZBCXYCBZ", "ZBCXYZCBA")
str_view(sample_string, "^(.).*\\1$")
```

### Exercise 4B

*Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)*

**`"(..).*\\1"`**

**See below for the regex in practice.  I tried adding {2} or ? but it didn't end the `churchitch` match after the second `ch`.**

```{r}
sample_string <- c("ABCCAB", "church", "ladeeadi", "ZBCXYXYZA", "churchitch")
str_view(sample_string, "(..).*\\1")
```

### Exercise 4C

*Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)*

**`"(.).*\\1.*\\1"`**

**See below**

```{r}
sample_string <- c("ABCCAB", "eleven", "DADDY", "ladeeadi", "ZBCXYAYAAY")
str_view(sample_string, "(.).*\\1.*\\1")
```
